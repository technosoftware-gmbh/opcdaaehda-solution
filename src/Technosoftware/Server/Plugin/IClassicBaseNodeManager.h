/**

 *
 * @brief   Custom mode browse handling.
 *          
 *          Called only from the generic server when
 *          <see cref="DaBrowseMode::Custom" text="DaBrowseMode.Custom" />
 *          is configured.
 *          
 *          This method returns the fully qualified name of the specified item in the current
 *          branch in the virtual address space. This name is used to add the item to the real
 *          address space. The generic server calls this function for OPC DA 2.05a and OPC DA
 *          3.00 client calls. The differences between the specifications is handled within the
 *          generic server part. Please note that flat address space is not supported.
 *          
 *          Provides a way to assemble a 'fully qualified' ITEM ID in a hierarchical space. This
 *          is required since the browsing functions return only the components or tokens which
 *          make up an ITEMID and do NOT return the delimiters used to separate those tokens.
 *          Also, at each point one is browsing just the names 'below' the current node (e.g. the
 *          'units' in a 'cell').
 *          
 *          A client would browse down from AREA1 to REACTOR10 to TIC1001 to CURRENT_VALUE. As
 *          noted earlier the client sees only the components, not the delimiters which are
 *          likely to be very server specific. The function rebuilds the fully qualified name
 *          including the vendor specific delimiters for use by ADDITEMs. An extreme example
 *          might be a server that returns: \\AREA1:REACTOR10.TIC1001[CURRENT_VALUE]
 *          
 *          It is also possible that a server could support hierarchical browsing of an address
 *          space that contains globally unique tags. For example in the case above, the tag
 *          TIC1001.CURRENT_VALUE might still be globally unique and might therefore be
 *          acceptable to AddItem. However the expected behavior is that (a) GetItemID will
 *          always return the fully qualified name (AREA1.REACTOR10.TIC1001.CURRENT_VALUE) and
 *          that (b) that the server will always accept the fully qualified name in AddItems
 *          (even if it does not require it).
 *          
 *          It is valid to form an ItemID that represents a BRANCH (e.g. AREA1.REACTOR10). This
 *          could happen if you pass a BRANCH (AREA1) rather than a LEAF (CURRENT_VALUE). The
 *          resulting string might fail if passed to AddItem but could be passed to
 *          ChangeBrowsePosition using OPC_BROWSE_TO.
 *          
 *          The client must free the returned string.
 *          
 *          ItemID is the unique 'key' to the data, it is considered the 'what' or 'where' that
 *          allows the server to connect to the data source.
 *
 * @param   actualPosition      Fully qualified name of the current branch.
 * @param   itemName            The name of a BRANCH or LEAF at the current level. Or a pointer
 *                              to a NULL string. Passing in a NULL string results in a return
 *                              string which represents the current position in the hierarchy.
 * @param [in,out]  fullItemId  Fully qualified name if the item. This name is used to access the
 *                              item or add it to a group.
